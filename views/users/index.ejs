		<p>Spotify Challenge Guessing Game is a a game where Spotify users can login using their Spotify accounts and guess songs from random selections of their own playlists.</p>
		
		<p>This application was built by <a href="http://www.lindsayelia.com/" target="blank">Lindsay Elia</a> as a fun project, inspired by some friends who like to challenge each other on music trivia in person. With an online version, now they can continue to challenge each other to guess from their own music playlists, any time they want to!</p>
		
		<p>The code for this application can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/LindsayElia/spotify-guessing-game" target="blank">github.com/LindsayElia/spotify-guessing-game</a>.</p>
