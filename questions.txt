Tim - if only one page is using a .js file, is it better to create a separate header partial for that page, so all of the other pages don't have to load that .js file when they won't be using it?

put it inside of that single page that is using it,
on the bottom
so everything else loads in case my js file breaks

and take it OUT of the header altogether
