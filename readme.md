# Full Stack JavaScript Project

## DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that you've learned so far to the test! For this project you will use your knowledge of front and back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by anyone! **You will be responsible for coming up with an idea** and you will be working **individually** on this project.

## MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
Your app must use/have all of the following:

* **Models.** Your app should have at least 3 models, with at least 1 association
* **Routes/Views.** Your routes should always strive to be **RESTful** and you should use partials to DRY up your views.
* **Handles/validates/secures data.** Your models should validate data and handle incorrect inputs (make sure you notify the user if there is an error). If you are storing passwords you **must** encrypt them.
* **External APIs.** Use an external API that we have not used in class to add functionality to your app.
* **Heroku.** Your code must be deployed to Heroku - we will be covering this shortly.
* **Authentication** Your site should have an authentication component (allow users to sign up / log in). 
* **Authorization** Where necessary, your application should contain an authorization scheme.  For example, if you make a blog app, other users should not be able to delete the posts that you create.

## ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES
Consider implementing some of the following with your app:

* **Styling with a CSS Framework.** Use either Twitter Bootstrap or Semantic UI to make your site look great.
* **Web Sockets** - Use [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) to have real time behavior in your app
* **Web Scraping.** Check out [Phantom.js](http://casperjs.org/) and [Casper.js](http://casperjs.org/).
* **OAuth** - Use [passport.js](http://passportjs.org/) for authentication using external providers (Facebook, Twitter, Github etc.)
* **Image Uploads** - For uploading and storing images, check out [uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com/)

## DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables:

* **Idea + Scope** What is your idea/app? What features will it have? Try to think of the minimal feature set your site needs in order to function. Get that working first, then focus on new features. 
* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what some of your pages will look like and how they will function. Paper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Balsamiq, Gliffy or Omnigraffle.
* **Object Modeling.** Draw out the model associations for your project and detail what information goes in your schemas.

####Completed Project deliverables:

* Link to your website hosted on Heroku
* Link to your source code on GitHub

## TIMELINE

* __Monday, June 22nd__ - Communicate your app idea to an instructor. Before beginning work on your project, your project idea and the scope of your project must be checked-off by an instructor.  You will need the following for an instructor check-off:
    - Wireframes and written Object Models 
    - A well-defined and written out feature list 
    - A written Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 
    
* __Monday, June 29th__ - Deploy your code to Heroku by the end of the day.  It is not important how much coding you have done at this point; deploy whatever you have.  Deploy to Heroku frequently to make your life easier.
* __Wednesday, July 1st at 9:30am__ - Project due and presentations 

## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
__Code Quality__ Make sure that your code is:

* Well-commented (descriptive, but obviously not overkill).
* Small commits pushed to GitHub frequently.  The commits should focus on a single change. Avoid large commits that deal with many distinct changes to the code. 
* Your ability to build an application with minimal help.
* Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourself.
